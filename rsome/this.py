praise = """Praise of DRO

In the world of optimization,
where models reign supreme,
there is one approach that stands out,
a star that shines and gleams.

Distributionally robust optimization,
a name both grand and bold,
is the method that ensures our models,
will not be easily controlled.

For in the real world, distributions vary,
and models can easily fail,
but DRO is a safeguard,
against this common tale.

It guards against worst-case scenarios,
and makes our models tough,
so they can handle any data,
and perform when things get rough.

DRO, we praise your robustness,
your ability to withstand,
the challenges of the real world,
and the tests that it demands.

You bring stability to our models,
and give us confidence in our results,
so we can make decisions with assurance,
and never fear the unknowns.

So here's to you, distributionally robust optimization,
our trusted friend and guide,
may you continue to protect our models,
and keep them safe inside.
